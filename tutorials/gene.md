# Single gene view

This page allows you to look at a gene in more detail. Click [here](https://opengenomebrowser.bioinformatics.unibe.ch/gene/FAM19471-i1-1.1_001004/)
for an example.

You will be able to see:

- its annotations
- its nucleotide sequence
- its protein sequence (unless the gene does not have a protein sequence, e.g. tRNAs)
- information from the GenBank file
- an interactive gene locus view
- if a cellular-location-annotation (certain GO-terms and SL-annotations) is available, a corresponding [swissbiopics](https://www.swissbiopics.org/)
  -plot is shown indicating where the gene/protein is expected to be located in the cell. Click here for
  an [example](https://opengenomebrowser.bioinformatics.unibe.ch/gene/FAM19038-p1-1.1_002669/).

## How to get there

To go to this view, click on a gene anywhere in OpenGenomeBrowser.

In [annotation search](annotation-search.md),
for [example](https://opengenomebrowser.bioinformatics.unibe.ch/annotation-search/?annotations=FAD-dependent!!!oxidoreductase+K00568&genomes=%40tax%3ABacteria)
, click on a cell with a number, then on a gene, and finally on `Open gene info`.
